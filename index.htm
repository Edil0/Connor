<h1> Network of survival of humanity: </h1>

<p> We are concerned about the threat of the destruction of humanity as a result of social polarization when using artificial intelligence to manipulate people. <br />
    Polarization was always there, but people were opposed by people not armed with a psycho machines.  <br />

    Surprisingly, this - the most important issue - is hardly discussed! <br />
    The terrible is not “Manipulated democracy”, but the fact that it can lead to the death of mankind. But people do not see it. </p>

<p>  Public attention and a network that would deal with this problem are needed. <br />
    If you agree with this, then could you express your opinion - what to do ? <br />
    Can you advise, for example, a social network that would: <br />
    1. It would not require any information about myself during registration , for example, for advertising.  <br />
    2. It would decentralized for unsinkability and unknown numbers of participants.  <br />
    3. It would allow, it is desirable, arbitrary structuring according to the opinions of participants.  <br />
    4. It would not use, it is desirable, anonymizer , since their use is prohibited. </p>

<p> We are a supporter of non-violence and intend to act 100% openly and within the framework of the law, but I am afraid to create an organization through social networks such as «VKontakte», since the issues affect the existing manipulation and polarization.  <br />
    We do not want to complicate the lives of participants living in authoritarian countries by divulging their personal data. </p>

<p> Reckon on not to hide, but to:  <br />
    1. The calm of the participants. <br />
    2. Lack of legal surveillance and evidence that Joe is Ivan. Those who hunt down will already be criminals. <br />
    3. The cost of tracking P2P-networks. <br />
    4. The use of anonymizers - under personal responsibility. <br />
    Normative decentralization is the absence of not only management, but also common rules and collective responsibility: <br />
    4.1. The cooperation of the participants is limited to the issues of survival of Civilization. <br />
    4.2. Independent arbitrary structuring, grouping of participants.  </p>

<p> Statements, for example, are not prosecuted in social networks , even «extremist»,  <br />
    But there is a criterion in the s-service manual - Creating an organization using social networks? <br />
    S-services are only interested by «destabilizing» actions and «here and now»? <br />
    Where are there more tips on personal safety , statistics of «violations» - repressions?  </p>

<p> For example, participants can develop recommendations for themselves on: <br />
    1. Activities under the law. <br />
    2. The increase in the costs of hunt down and interference. </p>

<h5> How to connect like-minded people on the topic ?: </h5>
<p> By «network marketing» mailing via e-mail it is not possible to gather like-minded people.  <br />
    We will try to compromise: <br />
    1. I still use Facebook, but not for correspondence, but for the swapping by e-mails. <br />
    2. Openness on my part. </p>

<p> We would be very grateful if you show my letter and coordinates to people concerned about the same threat. Or give them anonymous coordinates to me. <br />
    Where, in what networks do you recommend looking for activists who may be not indifferent to the problem? - In centralized organizations s coordinate their activists do not give .  <br />
    Or generally speak out on the problem. </p>

<p> Inform you about the progress of this project? <br />
    We also propose not to respond to insults - not to succumb to the provocations of «satanization». </p>
